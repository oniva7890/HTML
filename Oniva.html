<h1>Honey bees:</h1>

<h2><strong>Honey bees aresocial insects belonging to the genus Apis , known for living in large, complex colonies and producing honey.</strong></h2>

<h1>1. The Colony Hierarchy</h1>

<h2>● <strong>Workers</strong>: Thousands of sterile females that do all the labor—cleaning, feeding larvae, building wax combs, guarding the entrance, and foraging for nectar and pollen.</h2>
,<h2>● <strong>Drones</strong>: Several hundred males whose sole purpose is to mate with a new queen. They do not have stingers and are often expelled from the hive before winter to conserve food.</h2>

<h1>2. Life Cycle & Development</h1>

<h2>Honey bees undergo a four-stage life cycle called complete metamorphosis :</h2>

<h2><strong>1.Egg</strong>: Laid by the queen in hexagonal wax cells.</h2>
<h2><strong>2.Pupa</strong>: The cell is capped with wax while the bee develops wings, legs, and eyes.</h2>
<h2><strong>Adult</strong>: The bee chews its way out. Total development time varies: 16 days for queens, 21 days for workers, and 24 days for drones.<h2>
   <h1>3. Fascinating Facts</h1>

   <h2>● Communication: Bees use a "waggle dance"—a figure-eight movement—to tell others the exact direction and distance to a rich food source.</h2>
<h2>● <strong>Anatomy</strong>: They have five eyes (two large compound eyes and three small light-detecting ocelli) and can see ultraviolet light, helping them spot patterns on flowers that humans cannot see.</h2>
<h2>● <strong>Production</strong>: A single worker bee produces only about 1/12th of a teaspoon of honey in her lifetime.</h2>
<h2>● <strong>Winter Survival</strong>: They do not hibernate; instead, they cluster around the queen and shiver their wing muscles to keep the hive warm.</h2>

<h1>4. Products & Benefits</h1>

<h2>Beyond pollination, humans harvest several products from hives, including honey, beeswax (used in cosmetics and candles), propolis (a resin used as a sealant), and royal jelly.</h2>
